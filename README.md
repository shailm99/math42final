# 2019 MCM Problem A: A Game of Ecology

In the Game of Ecology problem, we were tasked with analyzing the characteristics and eco- logical interactions of three different dragons. We developed a first-order multivariable discrete time model that tracked four state variables over time: the weight of the dragon W in kilograms, its daily calorie requirement C, its height H, as well as the population P of the prey consumed by the dragon. After the construction of this baseline model, we altered parameters to represent the states of three dragons which each lived in a different climate. This allowed us to explore the impact of environmental factors on the growth of dragons. Interestingly, we found that dragons in cold, arctic environments tend to weigh more than those in warmer, arid regions. Furthermore, in larger habitats dragons can reach a greater weight due to the presence of an increased prey population. We then extended our original model to include stochasticity by modelling weight and height as random normal variables, and also considered environmental catastrophes that follow a Bernoulli distribution which affect the model parameters in different ways. Ultimately, however, the inclusion of stochasticity did not change the inherent behavior of the model.
